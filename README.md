Source code for the “Concurrency and Mutability” lesson
=======================================================

This project is intended to demonstrate the problem

This repository was created for my book,
[Learning Functional Programming in 
Scala](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/learning-functional-programming-in-scala-book).
